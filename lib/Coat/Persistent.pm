# defining the method in the package's namespace is far more efficient.

# made by mixing more than one attribute (find_by_foo_and_bar).

=head1 NAME

Coat::Persistent -- Simple Object-Relational mapping for Coat objects

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Coat::Persistent is an object to relational-databases mapper, it allows you to
build instances of Coat objects and save them into a database transparently.

You basically define a mapping rule, either global or per-class and play with
your Coat objects without bothering with SQL for simple cases (selecting,
inserting, updating). 

Coat::Peristent lets you use SQL if you want to, considering SQL is the best
language when dealing with compelx queries.

=head1 WHY THIS MODULE ?

There are already very good ORMs for Perl available in the CPAN so why did this
module get added?

Basically for one reason: I wanted a very simple way to build persistent
objects for Coat and wanted something near the smart design of Rails'ORM
(ActiveRecord). Moreover I wanted my ORM to let me send SQL requests if I
wanted to (so I can do basic actions without SQL and complex queries with SQL).

This module is the result of my experiments of mixing DBI and Coat together,
although it is a developer release, it works pretty well and fit my needs.

This module is expected to change in the future (don't consider the API to be
stable at this time), and to grow (hopefully).

The underlying target of this module is to port the whole ActiveRecord::Base
API to Perl. If you find the challenge and the idea interesting, feel free to 
contact me for giving a hand. 

This is still a development version and should not be used in production
environment. 

=head1 DATA BACKEND

The concept behing this module is the same behind the ORM of Rails : there are
conventions that tell how to translate a model meta-information into a SQL
one :

The conventions implemented in Coat::Persistent are the following:

=over 4

=item The primary key of the tables mapped should be named 'id'.

=item Your table names must be named like the package they map, with the following
rules applied : lower case, replace "::" by "_". For instance a class Foo::Bar
should be mapped to a table named "foo_bar".

=item All foreign keys must be named "<table>_id" where table is the name if the
class mapped formated like said above.

=back

You can overide those conventions at import time:

    package My::Model;
    use Coat;
    use Coat::Persistent 
            table_name  => 'mymodel', # default would be 'my_model'
            primary_key => 'mid';     # default would be 'id'

=head2 ABOUT PRIMARY KEYS

Even if your table does not have a primary key, you can still use a
Coat::Persistent model over it. You just have to tell Coat::Persistent that
this table/model doesn't have a primary key :

   use Coat::Persistent primary_key => undef;

Note that instances of such a model cannot be saved like regular ones: there's
no primary key, so it's impossible to build UPDATE SQL queries properly. That's
why you'll have to give a condition whenver you call save().

For the same reason, it's impossible to use find() with numeric values (whi are
assumed to be primary key values).

Example :
    package Model;
    ...
    use Coat::Persistent primary_key => undef;
    ...

    package  main;

    my $obj = Model->find(43); # FAIL : there's no primary key known for Model
    my $obj = Model->find_by_some_attribute(25); # OK

    $obj->save(); # FAIL : the SQL query cannot be built without a primary key
                  # defined

    $obj->save({some_attribute => 25}); # OK

Note that it's not recommended to use tables whithout primary keys, the support
is only provided to support existing/border-line database schemas we can find
in real-world.

Use that feature with caution!

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You have two options for setting a database handle to your class. Either you
already have a dbh an you set it to your class, or you don't and you let
Coat::Persistent initialize it.

If you already have a database handle, use:

    # $driver is the driver name of the database handle (mysql, sqlite, ...)
    # $dbh is the database handle previously inititalized
    Coat::Persistent->set_dbh( $driver => $dbh);

Otherwise, use the DBI mapping explained below.

head2 ALREADY EXISTING DATABASE HANDLE

You may want to tell Coat::Persistent to use a $dbh you already have in hands,
then you can use the set_dbh() method.

=over 4

=item B<set_dbh($driver => $dbh)>

Set the given database handle for the calling class (set it by default if class
is Coat::Persistent).

=back

=head2 DBI MAPPING

You have to tell Coat::Persistent how to map a class to a DBI driver. You can
either choose to define a default mapper (in most of the cases this is what
you want) or define a mapper for a specific class.

In order for your mapping to be possible, the driver you use must be known by
Coat::Persistent, you can modify its driver mapping matrix if needed.

=over 4

=item B<drivers( )>

Return a hashref representing all the drivers mapped.

  MyClass->drivers;

=item B<get_driver( $name )>

Return the Perl module of the driver defined for the given driver name.
  
  MyClass->get_driver( 'mysql' );

=item B<add_driver( $name, $module )>

Add or replace a driver mapping rule. 

  MyClass->add_driver( sqlite => 'dbi:SQLite' );

=back

Then, you can use your driver in mapping rules. Basically, the mapping will
generate a DBI-E<gt>connect() call.

=over 4 

=item B<Coat::Persistent-E<gt>map_to_dbi $driver, @options >

This will set the default mapper. Every class that hasn't a specific mapper set
will use this one.

=item B<__PACKAGE__-E<gt>map_to_dbi $driver, @options >

This will set a mapper for the current class.

=back

Supported values for B<$driver> are the following :

=over 4

=item I<csv> : this will use DBI's "DBD:CSV" driver to map your instances to a CSV
file. B<@options> must contains a string as its first element being like the
following: "f_dir=<DIRECTORY>" where DIRECTORY is the directory where to store
de CSV files.

Example:

    packahe Foo;
    use Coat::Persistent;
    __PACKAGE__->map_to_dbi('csv', 'f_dir=./t/csv-directory');

=item I<mysql> : this will use DBI's "dbi:mysql" driver to map your instances
to a MySQL database. B<@options> must be a list that contains repectively: the
database name, the database user, the database password.

Example:

    package Foo;
    use Coat::Persistent;
    __PACKAGE__->map_to_dbi('mysql' => 'dbname', 'dbuser', 'dbpass' );

=back

=head2 MYSQL AUTO-INCREMENT FEATURE

When using MySQL, you can choose either to let Coat::Persistent set itself 
primary key values for new entries, or use MySQL auto_increment mechanism.

This is done by calling Coat::Persistent->disable_internal_sequence_engine();
before any call to map_to_dbi() or set_dbh().

Currently, this is only tested to work with MySQL, patches for supporting 
other database engines are welcome.

Make sure you disable the internal sequence engine before initializing the $dbh,
otherwise the two tables needed by DBIx::Sequence will be created in your DB 
(dbix_sequence_release and dbix_sequence_state).

A typical use of a MySQL database with auto_increment primary keys woudl like
the following:

    # $dbh is an hanlde to a MySQL DB
    Coat::Persistent->disable_internal_sequence_engine();
    Coat::Persistent->set_dbh(mysql => $dbh);

=head2 CACHING

Since version 0.0_0.2, Coat::Persistent provides a simple way to cache the
results of underlying SQL requests. By default, no cache is performed.

You can either choose to enable the caching system for all the classes (global
cache) or for a specific class. You could also define different cache
configurations for each class.

When the cache is enabled, every SQL query generated by Coat::Persistent is
first looked through the cache collection. If the query is found, its cached
result is returned; if not, the query is executed with the appropriate DBI
mapper and the result is cached.

The backend used by Coat::Persistent for caching is L<Cache::FastMmap> which
is able to expire the data on his own. Coat::Persistent lets you access the
Cache::FastMmap object through a static accessor :

=over 4

=item B<Coat::Persistent-E<gt>cache> : return the default cache object

=item B<__PACKAGE__-E<gt>cache> : return the cache object for the class __PACKAGE__

=back

To set a global cache system, use the static method B<enable_cache>. This
method receives a hash table with options to pass to the Cache::FastMmap
constructor.

Example :

    Coat::Persistent->enable_cache(
        expire_time => '1h',
        cache_size  => '50m',
        share_file  => '/var/cache/myapp.cache',
    );

It's possible to disable the cache system with the static method
B<disable_cache>.

See L<Cache::FastMmap> for details about available constructor's options.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 CLASS CONFIGURATION

The following pragma are provided to configure the mapping that will be 
done between a table and the class.

=over 4

=item B<has_p $name =E<gt> %options>

Coat::Persistent classes have the keyword B<has_p> to define persistent
attributes. Attributes declared with B<has_p> are valid Coat attributes and
take the same options as Coat's B<has> method. (Refer to L<Coat> for details).

All attributes declared with B<has_p> must exist in the mapped data backend
(they are a column of the table mapped to the class).

=item B<has_one $class>

Tells that current class owns a subobject of the class $class. This will allow
you to set and get a subobject transparently.

The backend must have a foreign key to the table of $class.

Example:

    package Foo;
    use Coat::Persistent;

    has_one 'Bar';

    package Bar;
    use Coat::Persistent;

    my $foo = new Foo;
    $foo->bar(new Bar);

=item B<has_many $class>

This is the same as has_one but says that many items are bound to one
instance of the current class.
The backend of class $class must provide a foreign key to the current class.

=back

=head2 CLASS METHODS

The following methods are inherited by Coat::Persistent classes, they provide
features for accessing and touching the database below the abstraction layer.
Those methods must be called in class-context.

=over 4 

=item I<Find by id>: This can either be a specific id or a list of ids (1, 5,
6)

=item I<Find in scalar context>: This will return the first record matched by
the options used. These options can either be specific conditions or merely an
order. If no record can be matched, undef is returned.

=item I<Find in list context>: This will return all the records matched by the
options used. If no records are found, an empty array is returned.

=back

The following options are supported :

=over 4

=item B<select>: By default, this is * as in SELECT * FROM, but can be
changed.

=item B<from>: By default, this is the table name of the class, but can be changed
to an alternate table name (or even the name of a database view). 

=item B<order>: An SQL fragment like "created_at DESC, name".

=item B<group>: An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. 
Uses the GROUP BY SQL-clause.

=item B<limit>: An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should
be returned.

=back

Examples without options:

    my $obj = Class->find(23);
    my @list = Class->find(1, 23, 34, 54);
    my $obj = Class->find("field = 'value'");
    my $obj = Class->find(["field = ?", $value]);

Example with options:

    my @list = Class->find($condition, { order => 'field1 desc' })

=back

=item B<find_by_sql($sql, @bind_values>

Executes a custom sql query against your database and returns all the results
if in list context, only the first one if in scalar context.

If you call a complicated SQL query which spans multiple tables the columns
specified by the SELECT that aren't real attributes of your model will be
provided in the hashref of the object, but you won't have accessors.

The sql parameter is a full sql query as a string. It will be called as is,
there will be no database agnostic conversions performed. This should be a
last resort because using, for example, MySQL specific terms will lock you to
using that particular database engine or require you to change your call if
you switch engines.

Example:

    my $obj = Class->find_by_sql("select * from class where $cond");
    my @obj = Class->find_by_sql("select * from class where col = ?", 34);

=item B<create>

Creates an object (or multiple objects) and saves it to the database. 

The attributes parameter can be either be a hash or an array of hash-refs. These
hashes describe the attributes on the objects that are to be created.

Examples

  # Create a single new object
  User->create(first_name => 'Jamie')
  
  # Create an Array of new objects
  User->create([{ first_name => 'Jamie'}, { first_name => 'Jeremy' }])


=back
